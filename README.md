# airmonitor
Code for Arduino air quality monitor

code expects `arduino_secrets.h`. You can copy `arduino_secrets_example.h` and fill in the relevant values. 

Note that air quality retrieval stuff has only been tested in SF. No guarantee it'll work in other locations. 

Display stuff doesn't really work yet, it just prints out the current color. TODOs!
